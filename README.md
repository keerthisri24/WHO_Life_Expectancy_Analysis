# WHO_Life_Expectancy_Analysis

Our analysis and report details the best model we found to estimate life expectancy from data given on each country from 2000-2015 provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). We used a multiple linear regression model for the analysis. After determining that the HIV/AIDS variable needed to be log transformed, we employed backward selection to select the variables to best fit our model. We then studied each observation in our model through influential analysis to further investigate what countries and their corresponding years have an impact on our model. For further research we would like to study different groupings and some machine learning algorithms to find unique and possibly more accurate models to better predict average life expectancy of a country.

The .R file and .Rmd can be used to view the code and visualizations for this project. Our group was nominated by a professor to submit a 10-page document of our analysis for the USCLAP Competition.
